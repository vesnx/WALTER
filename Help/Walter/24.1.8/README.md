## How to Unblock a CHM File

When you download a `.chm` file from the internet, it may be blocked for security reasons. To unblock it:

1. Right-click on the `.chm` file and select `Properties`.
2. At the bottom of the Properties dialog, there is a `Security` section.
3. You'll find a checkbox saying `Unblock`. Check this box.
4. Click `Apply`, then `OK`.

This will unblock the file, allowing you to view its contents normally.
